Beer Hopper Proposal
=====================
By Group 3
---------------------

### Project Overview
---
Welcome to the world of Bar Hopping! err... Beer Hopping. 
We want to build an application that shares the world of microbrews to the public.
<p>
The goal of this website is to create a social network that allows people to share favorite beers, breweries and homebrew recipes with their peers.

### Page Breakdown
---
#### Sign in Page
The user should be able to sign in or create an account easily. 
When signing up, we should just require their birthday (for over 21 purposes), email (login id), and their name (first and last for local identity).

#### Profile Page
This porfile page is unique for each individual; yet the style remains the same.
The profile page is what the user first sees.
The page contains their 'feed' which is a list of all updates from their followers (both breweries and people alike)
